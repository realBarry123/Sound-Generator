# Sound-Generator

## Overview
This is a project that aims to help me create music with the help of simple Python programs

## Main.py
Running this file will give you 2 options: 
### 1: Generate Wav File
Writes a .wav file based on the given frequency, duration, and waveform shape
### 2: Create Random Music
Generates random notes and writes in a .wav file

## Experiment1.py
This writes a melody, chordal accompaniment, and bass line based on the generic C G A- F- progression
